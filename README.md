### Description: JavaScript — Object Oriented Programming using ES6</br>
ES6(ECMAScript2015) is a major upgrade to JavaScript. In this article we will learn the new way of achieving Object Oriented concepts like class, object, static properties, constructor and inheritance with super and extends in JavaScript. </br>


### Class and Object:</br>
Object is a thing which can be seen or touched and in software we try to represent the same real-life thing with object.</br>
Object Oriented Programing is nothing but code around that object.</br>
Class is not an object, it’s like blueprint which can generate objects. So, class helps to set the classification of objects with its properties and capabilities.</br>
Any number of instance can be created from a class, each instance is called Object.</br>

Constructor, Properties and Methods:</br>
Constructor is just a function which gets called automatically when we create an instance from the class.</br>
Instance variables get created and initialized using constructor.</br>
Instance variables are nothing but called properties of the object.</br>
Methods are again functions which attached with instance and all instance created from the same class will have those methods or actions.</br>
Accessing properties and methods inside class, we need this keyword.</br>
